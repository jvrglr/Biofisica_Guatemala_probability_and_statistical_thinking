# Biofísica Guatemala 2025: Probability and Statistical Thinking

Material for the course on Probability and Statistical Thinking.  
[Biofísica Guatemala 2025](https://indico.ictp.it/event/11227/).

The idea of the course is to condense a full master-level course on probability, statistics, and stochastic processes into a few lectures. Obviously, it is impossible to do this in a systematic and complete manner in such a short amount of time. Instead, the goal of the course is to provide a *flavour* of how these techniques can be used to address research problems.

The material for the course includes:
* Slides used in theoretical lectures.
* Summaries and problem sets for the hands-on sessions (with solutions).
* A few numerical and data analysis problems.

I thank all the students, professors, and organizers of the school, especially Carlos Enmanuel Soto Lopez, for noticing flaws and typos in the problems, slides, and code. If further typos are found, please contact jvrglrschz@gmail.com.

Feel free to distribute and use the content of these notes, except for the optical tweezers dataset, for which the following instructions apply. The experimental position data of the optically trapped particle were obtained from experiments performed by Miguel Ibáñez García (ibanez@ugr.es). Any commercial or research use of these data requires explicit approval from Miguel Ibáñez García and proper attribution to his work:
