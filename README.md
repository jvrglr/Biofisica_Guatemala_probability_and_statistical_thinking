# Biofisica Guatemala 2025: Probability and statistical thinking
Material for the course on Probability and statistical thinking. [Biofísica Guatemala 2025](https://indico.ictp.it/event/11227/) .

The idea of the course is to condensate a full course on probability, statistics and stochastic processes at master level in a few lectures. Obviously, it is impossible to do such thing in a systematic and complete manner in such small amount of time. The idea of the course is to give a ``flavour" of using such techniques to face resarch problems. 

The material for the couse includes:
* Slides used in theoretical lectures.
* Summary and problems of the hands-on sessions (with solutions).
* A few numerical and data analysis problems.

I thank all the students, professors and organizers of the school, specially to Carlos Enmanuel Soto Lopez, for noticing flaws and typos in the problems, slides and codes. Should more typos be noticed, please contact jvrglrschz@gmail.com.

Feel free to distribute and use the content of these notes, except for the dataset of optical tweezers, for which the next instructions apply: The experimental position data of the optically trapped particle were obtained from experiments performed by Miguel Ibáñez García (ibanez@ugr.es). Any commercial or research use of these data requires explicit approval from Miguel Ibáñez García and proper attribution to his work:
