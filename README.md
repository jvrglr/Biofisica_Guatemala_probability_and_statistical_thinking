# Biofisica Guatemala 2025: Probability and statistical thinking
Material for the course on Probability and statistical thinking. [Biofísica Guatemala 2025](https://indico.ictp.it/event/11227/) .

The idea of the course is to condensate a full course on probability, statistics and stochastic processes at master level in a few lectures. Obviously, it is impossible to do such thing in a systematic and complete manner in such small amount of time. The idea of the course is to give a ``flavour" of using such techniques to face resarch problems. 

The material for the couse includes:
* Slides used in theoretical lectures.
* Summary and problems of the hands-on sessions (with solutions).
* A few numerical and data analysis problems.

I thank all the students, professors and organizers of the school, specially to Carlos Enmanuel Soto Lopez, for noticing flaws and typos in the problems, slides and codes. I shall also thank 

Feel free to distribute and use the content of these notes, except for the dataset of optical tweezers, for which the next instructions apply: The experimental position data of the optically trapped particle were obtained from experiments performed by Miguel Ibáñez García (ibanez@ugr.es). Any commercial or research use of these data requires explicit approval from Miguel Ibáñez García and proper attribution to his work:
